This course is an introduction to the Python computing language through an exploration of contemporary uses of data and computing technology.  We will combine work on understanding the political developments with the human use of data and engage with actual implementation of code and data analysis.

## Course Requirements

- participate in class discussions on readings and computing work ( 20 %)

- contribute to slack each week (5 %)

- complete weekly assignments per chosen track (60%)

- complete final paper or computing project (15%)

### Technical and less-Technical 

These are our two tracks.  Everybody will code and learn Python.  We will decide whether or not we want to spend further time with this outside of class depending.  

**TECH**: 

- complete three problem sets.  

- final project should incorporate a substantial computing element, 15 pages including code and bibliography.

- short (3 min) final presentation on work

**LESS TECH**:

- 10 page paper on topic of choice

- 5 problem sets

- short (3min) final presentation on work
